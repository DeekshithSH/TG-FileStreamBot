TODO:

- Rewrite the entire project based on the Telethon client.
- Reuse code from `tg-filestream` to fetch files from the Telegram server.
- Add support for multiple databases.

Goal:
- Keep the links generated by the bot as consistent as possible.
  Even if the internal code changes, previously generated links should still work.
